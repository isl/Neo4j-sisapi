How to compile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a new java library project.
Until now we have used java jdk1.7.0_51 64 bit

- use the sources included in the /Sources/ folder 
  of this repository
  
- Download the neo4j jar files included in Neo4j-sis-api-Dependencies-LicensesUsed.txt
  (obtain Neo4j Community edition version 2.2.5 or perhaps 
  later and get the jar files from it's lib folder)

- create project references to these libraries

- Apply jvm option -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 (Perhaps not needed step)

You must now be able to compile
