This file is part of the Neo4j-sisapi project.

How to compile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a new java library project.

Until now we have used java jdk1.8.0_231 64 bit

- Use the sources included in the /Sources/src folder 
  of this repository
  
- Neo4j v 3.2.5 Community Edition should automatically 
  be downloaded by a maven supporting IDE
 
- Apply jvm option -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 (Perhaps not needed step)

You must now be able to compile
and create a dist folder containing 
- Neo4j-sisapi-{version}.jar
- Neo4j-sisapi-{version}-javadoc.jar
- Neo4j-sisapi-{version}-sources.jar
- TSV folder containing the model files with which this code works with
